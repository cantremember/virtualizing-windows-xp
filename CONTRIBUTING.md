This was originally a *very targeted repo* -- how to use Windows XP + VirtualBox + Ghost to virtualize XP.
I'm totally happy with the community evovling it beyond that, if it wishes.

Also, my word is certainly not a Gold Standard.
If there's corrections or additions to be made, kindly let me know.
PRs from a fork are preferred, vs. Issues.

Please excuse that these documents are written very much from my perspective.
It was originally a blog post, and evolved into more of a Guide To What You Might Bump Into.
It might read better as a boring, dry reference guide.
