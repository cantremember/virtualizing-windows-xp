# Virtualizing Windows XP

A trieste on my experiences virtualizing Windows XP to create long-term homes for old workstations.

> *WARNING:  laughably old dustware will be discussed here*

---

In the past, I've taken on the task of virtualizing several ancient Windows XP boxes.
The OS has been [end-of-lifed](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/end-of-support.aspx),
but in its time, XP captured the imagination of *millions* --
and it still runs all the apps I care about, on the rare occasions that I need them.
And all the backups in the world can't save you when your hardware bites the dust.

This repo outlines some [Tools](Tools.md) &amp; [Techniques](Techniques.md) for the virtualization process, in case it's of help to others.
It's also a compendium of **truly useful** online resources.
It could have been a blog post, but I find my learnings will be best served by tons of hyperlinking.

I provide two examples:

- A [Simple Basic](Example-Simple.md) one.
- [The Inspiron](Example-Inspiron.md) - a more complex example with an OEM partition and a Brain Transplant.
